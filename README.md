**Target Site**: `testasp.vulnweb.com`

### Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. **Reflected XSS**: Identified on the Search page by injecting scripts into input fields.
2. **SQL Injection (Error-Based)**: Identified on the Login page using logical bypass payloads.

### Documentation Included:
* **Step-by-step reproduction instructions**: Detailed walkthroughs for each vulnerability.
* **Burp Suite Repeater logs**: Raw Requests and Responses proving the server-side flaws.
* **Video Proof of Concept (PoC)**: A screen recording demonstrating the successful execution of the XSS alert box.
